# mender-mcu-integration

Mender is an open source over-the-air (OTA) software updater for embedded devices. Mender
comprises a client running at the embedded device, as well as a server that manages deployments
across many devices.

Mender provides modules to integrate with Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS). The code can be found
in [`mender-mcu` repository](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-mcu/).

This repository contains a reference project on how to integrate a user application with Mender OTA
Zephyr Module, using QEMU as the board of choice.

## Project Status

This repository is a work in progress. As we continue development, features and functionality may
evolve significantly.


## Getting started

Since the project is under active development, we recommend watching the repository or checking back
regularly for updates. Detailed documentation and usage instructions will be provide d as the
project progresses.

To start using Mender, we recommend that you begin with the Getting started
section in [the Mender documentation](https://docs.mender.io/).

## Building the Zephyr Project Mender reference app

**TODO**: Rework instructions once `mender-mcu` and `mender-mcu-integration` repo are public.

To add Mender OTA Zephyr Module on your project, create first a vanilla Zephyr workspace and
manually set the manifest to point to this repository.

```
west init workspace
cd workspace
git clone git@github.com:mendersoftware/mender-mcu-integration
sed  -i .west/config -e 's|path = zephyr|path = mender-mcu-integration|'
west update
```

*In the future this will look like*

```
west init workspace --manifest-url https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-mcu-integration
cd workspace && west update
```

Now build and run the reference application with:

:warning: Work in progress :warning:

```
west build --build-dir build-qemu --board qemu_x86 mender-mcu-integration
west build --build-dir build-qemu --target run
```
