# mender-mcu-integration

Mender is an open source over-the-air (OTA) software updater for embedded devices. Mender
comprises a client running at the embedded device, as well as a server that manages deployments
across many devices.

Mender provides modules to integrate with Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS). The code can be found
in [`mender-mcu` repository](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-mcu/).

This branch contains an ESP-IDF (FreeRTOS) demo app, pulling in the
`mender-mcu` client through the IDF component manager.

## Get started

Requires ESP-IDF 6.0 or later. To build for ESP32-S3:

```
idf.py set-target esp32s3
idf.py menuconfig   # set the Wi-Fi credentials under "Mender Reference App"
idf.py build
idf.py flash monitor
```

The app initializes the client. Most of the platform
backends are not implemented yet, so initialization is expected to fail with
NOT_IMPLEMENTED until they land.
